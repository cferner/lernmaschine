abstract: "The nationwide rollout of smart meters in private households raises privacy concerns: Is it possible to extract privacy-sensitive information from a householdâ€™s power consumption? For a small sample of 869 Upper Austrian households, information about consumption-heavy amenities and household characteristics are available. This work studies the detection of households with swimming pools (the most common amenity in the dataset) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied on load heatmaps constructed from load profiles. Although only a small dataset is available, results show that by using CNNs, privacy can be broken automatically, i.e., without the time-consuming, manual feature generation. The method even slightly outperforms a previous approach that relies on a nearest neighbor classifier with engineered features."
