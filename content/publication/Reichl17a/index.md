abstract: "This research estimates the impact of capacity, volumetric, and peak-load-based network tariff schemes on different types of household consumers based on their socio-economic characteristics and actual energy demand. Due to expected significant changes in energy consumption patterns on the household level in the near future (increasing own production, in-home batteries, house-to-house electricity trading and decreasing demand), commonly applied volumetric tariffs may induce a significant imbalance between different groups of households and their respective contribution to recovering the costs of operating the grid (THINK Project Final Report, 2013). While so-called prosumers may reduce their quantities of electricity purchased via the power grid, non-prosumers completely rely on the grid for their electricity supply. Volumetric tariffs are determined by the amount of energy consumed, therefore additional burdens may shift towards non-prosumers that are still exclusively supplied by the grid and have poor access to such technologies as photovoltaic or in-home batteries for financial reasons (EURELECTRIC, 2013). This could result in even higher electricity bills for a less privileged group of consumers. It will also a priori turn into higher burdens for the households residing in apartment buildings compared to those living in single-family dwellings, as they do not have the needed property rights and space for necessary installations. An introduction of new metering technologies will allow implementation of alternative tariffs based on the amount of demand peaks produced by the household, which should reflect more accurately the nature of network costs. While there is a vast literature on optimal electricity pricing, the literature on optimal network tariffs is considerably slimmer and empirical research providing data on the impact of different network tariffs on customers, based on their socioeconomic characteristics and actual energy consumption, is non-existent due to the lack of fine-grained electricity consumption data for households. The lack of such data has lead to a lack of transparency in network tariffs methodologies and a certain resistance of regulatory authorities to adjust currently applied tariffs to new circumstances, as it is unclear how the costs will be redistributed and whether such a redistribution could hurt marginalized consumers, especially low-income households. Our research provides important empirical evidence filling this gap in the literature and allows decision makers to assess the strengths and weaknesses of different tariff structures ex ante, and thereby helping to avoid electricity consumers becoming guinea pigs in the pending adaption of regulatory practice to the future electricity system."
