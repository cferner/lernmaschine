I am currently a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Salzburg. I am affiliated with both the [Applied Data Science Lab](https://its.fh-salzburg.ac.at/forschung/applied-data-science-lab/) and the [Lab for Intelligent Data Analytics](https://ida-lab.sbg.ac.at/) in Salzburg, Austria.
